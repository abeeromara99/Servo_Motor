# Servo_Motor  
-This project utilizes Atmega32 microcontroller,keypad,LCD (16x2)character,DC_Motor , Stepper_Motor and Servo_Motor 

# Driver Implemented: 
1-DIO driver  
2-Timers driver
3-LCD driver  
4-KEYPAD driver  
5-Stepper_Motor driver  
6-DC_Motor driver  
7-Servo_Motor driver  

# How it works ?  
-when you enter the correct password , it takes you to the next window and you only have 3 attempts to try it.If you enter the password incorrectly more than 3 times,the system will shut down for 5 seconds.
-The Next window have Three choose:  
1-DC_Motor  
2-Stepper_Motor
3-Servo_Motor  
4-Exit  
-If you choose DC_motor and the next window opend, this window contain four choices:  
1-for Rotate CW  
2-for Rotate CCW  
3-For STOP  
4-press any key to take you to the previous window  
-If you choose Stepper_Motor and the next window opend, in this window you shall Enter your rotating angle and then choose direction:  
1-for Rotate CW  
2-for Rotate CCW    
3-press any key to take you to the previous window   
-If you choose Servo_Motor then it will moved to your rated angle
